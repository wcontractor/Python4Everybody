##Python For Everybody
This respository, the code and the data samples, were created while completing the Coursera Python for Everyone 5 part specialization. 

###Python for Informatics
This specialization is based on the book Python for Informatics by Charles Severance.

###Python versions
The course suggests that you use Python 2.7 however, I tried to use Python 3.5 where ever I could.  DataStructures was completed entirely in 3.5 however weeks 3-6 of WebData were completed in Python 2.7.  To manage multiple Python environments I used Anaconda and installed both 2.7 and 3.5 on the same machine then switched environments by using "activate <env name>"
